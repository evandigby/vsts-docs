## Unsubscribe or opt out of a team or OOB subscription

You can choose to not receive notifications for certain team subscriptions by opting out of the subscription. To unsubscribe from any notification, even one that you've defined, slide the State **On/Off** indicator to the *Off* position.
 
For example, here we turn off the Build completes subscription.
