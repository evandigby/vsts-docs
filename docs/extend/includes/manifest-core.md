These properties are required:

| Property | Description | Notes |
|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| **manifestVersion** | *A number corresponding to the version of the manifest format.*  | Should be `1`. |
| **ID** | *The extension's identifier.* | Th ID is a string that must be unique among extensions from the same publisher. It must start with an alphabetic or numeric character and contain 'A' through 'Z', 'a' through 'z', '0' through '9', and '-' (hyphen). Example: `sample-extension`. |
| **version** | *A string specifying the version of an extension.* | Should be in the format `major.minor.patch`, for example `0.1.2` or `1.0.0`. You can also add a fourth number for the following format: `0.1.2.3`|
| **name** | *A short, human-readable name of the extension. Limited to 200 characters.* | Example: `"Fabrikam Agile Board Extension"`. |
| **publisher** | *The identifier of the publisher.* | This identifier must match the identifier the extension is published under. See [Create and manage a publisher](../publish/overview.md). |
| **categories** | *Array of strings representing the categories your extension belongs to. At least one category must be provided and there's no limit to how many categories you may include.* | Valid values: `Azure Repos`, `Azure Boards`, `Azure Pipelines`, `Azure Test Plans`, and `Azure Artifacts`.<br/><br/>Notes:<ul><li>Use version >=0.6.3 of the tfx-cli if you're publishing the extension programmatically. </li><li>If you're using [Azure DevOps Extension Tasks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vsts-developer-tools-build-tasks) to publish, ensure that its version is >= 1.2.8. You might have to approve the extension update because of recent scope changes.</li><li>The categories previously mentioned are natively present in Visual Studio Marketplace and Azure DevOps Server 2019 & above. For extensions targeting earlier versions of TFS:<ul><li> If TFS customers acquire your extension via Visual Studio Marketplace (not local gallery) in connected context, then use the categories that are previously stated. </li><li> If you are going to share the extension directly (that is, not via the Visual Studio Marketplace) with a customer using TFS <=2018 then use the following categories instead: Code, Plan and track, Build and release, Test, Collaborate, and Integrate. If you need to share both via Visual Studio Marketplace and directly with a TFS <= 2018 customer then you would need to have 2 extension packages.</li></ul></ul>|
| **targets** | *The products and services supported by your integration or extension.* For more information, see [installation targets](../develop/manifest.md#installation-targets). | An array of objects, where each object has an `id` field indicating one of the following: <ul><li>`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services` (extensions that works with Azure DevOps or TFS),</li><li> `Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server` (extension that works with TFS),</li><li> `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Integration` (integrations that works with Azure DevOps or TFS), </li><li>`Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server.Integration` (integrations that work with TFS)</li></ul> |
