# Publish Pipeline Artifacts task

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a pipeline to publish your artifacts(note that publishing is NOT supported in release pipelines. It is supported in multi-stage pipelines, build pipelines, and yaml pipelines).

> [!TIP]
> Looking to get started with build artifacts? See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../../artifacts/pipeline-artifacts.md).

## YAML snippet

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/yaml/PublishPipelineArtifactV1.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The `publish` and `download` keywords are shortcuts for the **Publish Pipeline Artifact** task. You can use them in your pipeline to publish and download artifacts. For more information, see [Publish](../../yaml-schema.md#publish) and [Download](../../yaml-schema.md#download) in the YAML schema.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| targetPath | Path to the folder or file you want to publish. The path must be a fully qualified path or a valid path relative to the root directory of your repository. (Required) See [Publishing artifacts](../../artifacts/pipeline-artifacts.md#publish-artifacts). |
| artifactName | Your artifact name. You can specify any name you prefer. E.g.: `drop` (Optional) |
| artifactType | Artifacts publish location. Choose whether to store the artifact in Azure Pipelines, or to copy it to a file share that must be accessible from the pipeline agent. (Required). Options: pipeline, filepath. Default value: pipeline |
| fileSharePath | The file share to which the artifact files will be copied. This can include variables. Required when `artifactType` = `filepath`. E.g: `\server\folderName` |
| parallel | Select whether to copy files in parallel using multiple threads for greater potential throughput. If this setting is not enabled, one thread will be used. (Optional). Default value: false| 
| parallelCount | Enter the degree of parallelism, or number of threads used, to perform the copy. (Optional) The value must be at least 1 and not greater than 128. |
