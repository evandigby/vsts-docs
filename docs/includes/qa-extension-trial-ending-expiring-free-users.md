#### Q: What should I do when the trial is almost expired or has ended for extensions that include free users?

A: To keep or restore access to an extension that includes free users, 
[assign the extension up to the number of free users that you get](../marketplace/install-extension.md). 
For additional users who need access, [assign the extension to these users](../marketplace/install-extension.md). Otherwise, non-free users lose access upon extension trial expiration.
