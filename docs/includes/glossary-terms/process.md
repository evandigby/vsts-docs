## Process

A process defines the building blocks of a work-tracking system. To customize a process, you first create an inherited process from one of the default system processes, [Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md). All projects that use the process see the changes you make. To learn more, see [About process customization and inherited processes](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).
