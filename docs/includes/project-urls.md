> Project URLs have changed with the release of Azure DevOps Services and now have the format `dev.azure.com/{your organization}/{your project}`, but you can still use the existing `visualstudio.com` format. For more information, see [Visual Studio Team Services is now Azure DevOps Services](../user-guide/about-azure-devops-services-tfs.md#visual-studio-team-services-is-now-azure-devops-services).
