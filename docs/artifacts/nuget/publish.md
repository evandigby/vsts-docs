# Publish a NuGet package using the command line

**Azure DevOps Services** | **Team Foundation Server 2018** | **Team Foundation Server 2017**

[!INCLUDE [](../includes/nuget/publish.md)]

## Work with upstream sources

Upstream sources enable you to use a single feed to store and consume packages from both public (NuGet.org, npmjs.com, Maven Central, and PyPI) and authenticated feeds (Azure Artifacts feeds).

See [Understanding upstream sources](../concepts/upstream-sources.md) to get familiar with the concepts. You can also check out the following articles to learn how to:

- [Set up upstream sources for Azure DevOps](../how-to/set-up-upstream-sources.md). 
- [Protect your open-source software packages with upstream sources](../tutorials/protect-oss-packages-with-upstream-sources.md).
