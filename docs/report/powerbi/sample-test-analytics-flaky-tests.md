# Flaky tests sample report

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-azure-devops-cloud.md)]

This article shows you how to create a report that shows the list of flaky tests for a pipeline. An example is shown in the following image.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Test Summary - Report](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/flaky-tests-report1.png)

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

Specifically, you'll find sample queries for the following reports: 

- Flaky tests for build workflow
- Flaky tests for release workflow
- Flaky tests for a particular branch
- Flaky tests for a particular test file
- Flaky tests for a particular test owner

## Sample queries

#### [Power BI query](#tab/powerbi/)

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-powerbi-query.md)]

```
let
   Source = OData.Feed (""
in
    Source
                &"Pipeline/PipelineId eq 7813 "
                &"And Date/Date ge 2020-02-04Z "
        &"And Workflow eq 'Build') "
        &"/groupby((TestSK, Test/TestName), "
            &"aggregate( "
                &"ResultCount with sum as TotalCount, "
                &"ResultPassCount with sum as PassedCount, "
            &"ResultFailCount with sum as FailedCount, "
                &"ResultNotExecutedCount with sum as NotExecutedCount, "
            &"ResultNotImpactedCount with sum as NotImpactedCount, "
        &"ResultFlakyCount with sum as FlakyCount)) "

    ,null, [Implementation="2.0",OmitValues = ODataOmitValues.Nulls,ODataVersion = 4]) 
in
    Source
```

#### [OData query](#tab/odata/)

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-odata-query.md)]

```
https://analytics.dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_odata/v4.0-preview/TestResultsDaily?
$apply=filter(
	Pipeline/PipelineName eq '{pipelineName}'
	And Date/Date ge {startdate}
	And Workflow eq 'Build'
	)
/groupby(
	(TestSK, Test/TestName), 
	aggregate(
	ResultCount with sum as TotalCount,
	ResultPassCount with sum as PassedCount,
	ResultFailCount with sum as FailedCount,
	ResultNotExecutedCount with sum as NotExecutedCount,
	ResultNotImpactedCount with sum as NotImpactedCount,
	ResultFlakyCount with sum as FlakyCount))
/filter(FlakyCount gt 0)
/compute(
	(FlakyCount div cast(TotalCount, Edm.Decimal)) mul 100 as FlakyRate
)
```

### Substitution strings

Each query contains the following strings that you must substitute with your values. Don't include brackets {} with your substitution. For example if your organization name is "Fabrikam", replace {organization} with **Fabrikam**, not {Fabrikam}.
 
- {organization} - Your organization name
- {project} - Your team project name
- {pipelinename} - Your pipeline name. Example: **Fabrikam hourly build pipeline**.
- {startdate} - The date to start your report. Format: YYYY-MM-DDZ. Example: **2019-09-04Z** represents September 4, 2019. Don't enclose in quotes or brackets and use two digits for both, month and date.

### Query breakdown

The following table describes each part of the query.

<table width="90%">
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td width="25%"><b>Query part</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><tr>
<tr><td><code>$apply=filter(</code></td>

<tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Power BI transforms

The query returns some columns that you need to expand and flatten into its fields before you can use them in Power BI. In this example such an entity is Test.

After closing the Advanced Editor and while remaining in the Power Query Editor, select the expand button on **Test**.

### Expand the Test column

1. Choose the expand button

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI + OData - Choose expand button](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/failed-tests-expand1.png)
    
1. Select the checkbox "(Select All Columns)" to expand

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI + OData - Select all columns](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/failed-tests-expand2.png)

1. The table now contains the expanded entity **Test.TestName**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI + OData - Expanded entity](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/failed-tests-expand3.png)
    

### Change column type

The query doesn't return all the columns in the format in which you can directly consume them in Power BI reports. Therefore, you can change the column type as shown.

1. Change the type of column **TotalCount**, **PassedCount**, **FailedCount**, **NotExecutedCount**, **NotImpactedCount** and **FlakyCount** to **Whole Number**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI + OData - change column type](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/failed-tests-changetype1.png)
    
1. Change the type of column **FlakyRate** to **Decimal Number**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Change the type of column FlakyRate to Decimal Number.](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/flaky-tests-changetype1.png)


### Rename fields and query, then Close & Apply

When finished, you may choose to rename columns. 

1. Right-click a column header and select **Rename...**

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Columns](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/failed-tests-rename1.png)

1. You also may want to rename the query from the default **Query1**, to something more meaningful. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Query](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/renamequery.png)

1. Once done, choose **Close & Apply** to save the query and return to Power BI.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Close & Apply](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/closeandapply.png)
  
  
## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Test Summary - Fields](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/flaky-tests-field1.png)

For a simple report, do the following steps:

1. Select Power BI Visualization **Table**.
1. Add the field "Test.TestName" to **Values**.
1. Add the field "TotalCount" to **Values**.
1. Add the field "PassedCount" to **Values**.
1. Add the field "FailedCount" to **Values**.
1. Add the field "FlakyCount" to **Values**.
1. Add the field "FlakyRate" to **Values**
    
Your report should look like this. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Test Summary - Report](media/odata-powerbi-test-analytics/flaky-tests-report1.png)


You can use the following additional queries to create different but similar reports using the same steps defined previously in this article.

## Flaky tests for Release workflow

You may want to view the flaky tests of a pipeline for **Release** workflow, instead of Build workflow.

#### [Power BI query](#tab/powerbi/)

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-powerbi-query.md)]

```
let
   Source = OData.Feed (""
in
    Source
                &"Pipeline/PipelineName eq '{pipelineName}' "
                &"And Date/Date ge {startdate}) "
        &"/groupby((TestSK, Test/TestName, Workflow), "
        &"aggregate( "
            &"ResultCount with sum as TotalCount, "

        &"/filter(FlakyCount gt 0) "
    &"/compute( "
    &"(FlakyCount div cast(TotalCount, Edm.Decimal)) mul 100 as FlakyRate) "
    ,null, [Implementation="2.0",OmitValues = ODataOmitValues.Nulls,ODataVersion = 4])

    Source
```

/compute(
(FlakyCount div cast(TotalCount, Edm.Decimal)) mul 100 as FlakyRate)
```

## Filter by branch

You may want to view the flaky tests of a pipeline for a particular branch only. To create the report, perform the following additional steps along with what is defined previously in this article.

- Expand Branch into Branch.BranchName
- Select Power BI Visualization Slicer and add the field Branch.BranchName to the slicer's Field
- Select the pipeline from the slicer for which you need to see the outcome summary
