We **strongly recommend** you use [Azure Test Plans](../overview.md#manual-testing-in-test-manager) or the **Test** hub in Azure DevOps (a fully featured Test management solution) over Microsoft Test Manager for all your test management requirements. **No new versions of Microsoft Test Manager are planned**. Microsoft Test Manager 2017 (which shipped with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017) is the last version.
